# Simple Networking Plugin
A plugin for the Godot game engine that provides a simple drag-and-drop networking interface that requires as little code as possible.

Inlcuded: 
A Networking global script that provides many networking functions, including: state changes, creating players, and receiving local and global IP addresses from an API.
A NetworkSyncer node that allows a user to type-in the properties of the parent that need to be synced. Lastly, an example lobby for rapid prototyping that also functions as a lobby demo.

This is still in development, expect a lot of issues and missing features (interpolation being one of them).

The networking state-syncer is heavily based on vec64's Godot-Multiplayer-FPS https://github.com/vec64/Godot-Multiplayer-FPS
